        Hey, it's Shihab! I get hooked on a project within hours every time I start coding. My strongest suit is consistency in everything I commit toâ€”whether it's coding big projects or maintaining academic performance.

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
        My passion for problem-solving and commitment to consistency helped me thrive in challenging environments and achieve the milestones I set for myself.

        Apart from these, I'm a big EDM fan and love playing around with my DAW (the software I use to make dance music). I also enjoy swimming, playing soccer, and a bunch of other outdoor activities.
