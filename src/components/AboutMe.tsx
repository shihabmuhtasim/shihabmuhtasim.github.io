      Hey, I’m Shihab. I’ve always been drawn to solving real-life problems through tech. I enjoy building websites, exploring different corners of AI, and figuring out how tech can actually make a difference in real life. What keeps me going is consistency—it’s what’s helped me grow, one step at a time.

        Apart from these, I'm a massive EDM enthusiast. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me diving into EDM production , exploring new places, swimming, playing soccer.  I also enjoy travelling and meeting new people.
